Fox Mulder has pursued the paranormal after his sister was abducted in uncertain 
circumstances. He was able to access his repressed memories, and remembered a 
bright light during the abduction, and something in the room.<BR>
Mulder joined the FBI in 1988, working in the Violent Crimes Unit. 
He soon heard of the X-Files Unit, and in 1991 persuaded his superiors to transfer him
there where he has worked since. In 1992 he was assigned a partner...

A doctor by profession, Scully joined the X-Files Unit after teaching at Quantico
Academy.  She doesn't have the same beliefs as Mulder, always offering a scientific 
explnation to the phenomina they investigate. Scully was originally assigned to debunk
the X-Files, but became friends with Mulder and followed the cases with him.<BR>

<A NAME="Deep">

<IMG SRC="dt.jpg" ALIGN="left" VSPACE="1" HSPACE="20"></A>

<BR>

<H3>Deep Throat</H3>

During the first season, Deep throat (He never used his real name) was Mulder and Scullys
one and only ally. He would constantly pop up with pieces of information for Mulder, which
would help him in the case he was currently investigating. Deep throat at one time said he had
actually killed an alien being.. and was aware of alien life living within humans. Deep Throat
was eventually killed off in 'The Erlenmeyer Flask' after saving Mulders life at the price of 
his own.

<BR>

<H3>Mr X</H3>

Mr X came on as Deep Throats replacement in the second season, but was nowhere near as helpful
or friendly as his predecessor. He constantly told Mulder of how he was risking his life speaking
to him, and does not want to end up like Deep Throat. On some occasions, he has even refused to
help Mulder and Scully with their cases. In 'Soft Light' he interferes directly with one of their 
cases, abducting a scientist so he can be studied. Mulder says he wants nothing more to do with him.

<A NAME="Skinner">

<IMG SRC="skinner.jpg" align="left" VSPACE="1" HSPACE="20"></A>

<H3>Assistant Director Walter Skinner</H3>

A.D Skinner is Mulder and Scullys supervisor. He is strict, and often at odds with Mulder because of
his by-the-book investigative tecniques. He is frequently in contact with The Cigarette Smoking Man (see
below), although their relationship is ambiguous at best. At one time, Skinner shut down the X-Files on 
'orders from above', but he later re-opened them of his own authority. Since then, he has tried to protect
the two agents from danger within the government.

<A NAME="CSM">

<IMG SRC="smoke.jpg" align="right" VSPACE="1" HSPACE="20"></A>

<H3>Cigarette Smoking Man</H3>

Often referred to as 'Cancer man', CSM will stop at nothing to shut down the X-Files. In 'Sleepless', when
asked by shadowy figures about Scully replied, "Every problem has a solution" A couple of episodes later, Scully
was abducted, and was found months later in a coma. This shows the ruthlessness he possesses, and his determination
to stop Mulder and Scully from finding 'The Truth'.
