<H2>Season 1 repeats</H2>

With the end of Season 2, the Beeb has decided to show season one on Mondays, 9.00pm, BBC2.
However, there seems to be some confusion over what episodes will be shown. According to the BBC,
the WHOLE season will be shown. According to TV guides and newspapers, SELECTED episodes will be 
shown. Hmmm.. According to my calculations, if the full season is shown, season 3 will start on the 
9th of September. Didn't season 2 start late August?.. Maybe the TV guide is right after all..<BR><BR>

<H2>X-Files movie.. will they, won't they?</H2>

There is still a lot of debating about the film. In a recent X-Files convention, Chris Carter stated 
that in order to make a film, they would either cut down on series filming (less episodes), or wait untill 
the end of the contract and start filming in a few years. (Thanks to <A HREF="mailto:fjc12951@slip.net">Michelle</A>
 for that.)<BR>
Doesn't sound good, does it?
