One of the things I've noticed about all the X-Files sites on the Internet
is the lack of quizzes. In fact, I think this is one of about three. :)
<BR><BR>
There are two sections.. medium and hard, and since this is in the UK,
I won't go any further than the Anasazi trilogy for questions.
<BR><BR>
At the end of the quiz, you can send your answers to me, and I will print
the owners of the correct entries. You will need a FORMS compatible browser..
If you don't have one, just E-Mail me the answers.<BR>
GOOD LUCK!

Oh, and by the way, because of a £260 phone bill I will only be using the Internet 
during the weekend, so quiz answers will not be checked until then.<BR><BR><BR>
